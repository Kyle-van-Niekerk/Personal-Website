            <p>Iâ€™m a junior Full Stack Web Developer interested in building beautiful, functional and effective websites. I started to learn code in 2018 and after a couple of months I was able to build web applications. During my training I was responsible for building a large-scaled app called YelpCamp, which involved both front-end and back-end technology. I am now currently building experience by working on my personal portfolio.</p>
            <p>The main languages I work with are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however I am also familiar with other languages and technology. If you are looking for a website or a web application, you can contact me through the information on the right. For a limited time only I am open to building projects pro bono as I am looking to build experience. Have a look at some of my previous work and if you like it, feel free to contact me.</p>
