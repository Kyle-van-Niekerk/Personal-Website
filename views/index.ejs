                    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                    <p>Iâ€™m a junior Full Stack Web Developer interested in building beautiful, functional and effective websites. I started to learn code in 2018 and after a couple of months I was able to build web applications. During my training I was responsible for building a large-scaled app called YelpCamp, which involved both front-end and back-end technology. I am now currently building experience as a freelancer by working on my personal portfolio.</p>
